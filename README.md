# Python-Port-Scanner
A Python port Scanner with mulit threading made to play around with argparse and the socket module from python. 
Inspired by projects like https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/port-scanner-in-python/ 
and https://pythonprogramming.net/python-port-scanner-sockets/. 

Made in conjunction with the watching of the video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GriwyvJzio&amp;list=PLLKT__MCUeiwBa7d7F_vN1GUwz_2TmVQj&amp;index=3 
by The Cyber Mentor. This is my first security based project.

For all questions regarding the use of the script in the directory where it is located enter
python3 portScanner.py -h
